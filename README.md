- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adityaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
- ⚡ **Fun fact:**
```java
 1 = '1' != 2
 ```
- Just another day on GItHub. 
```java
if (dayOfWeek == "Sunday" && month == "July" && currentYear % 4 == 0) {
  System.out.println("It's a leap year Sunday in July! Prepare for... nothing special.");
}
```
- ☕️ 
- 1 cup of coffee,
- 2 lines of code,
- 3 Bugs,
- 4 Days wasted ...
